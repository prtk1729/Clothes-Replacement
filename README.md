#### Clothes-Replacement
This project combines Image Segmentation and Stable Diffusion techniques for a clothes replacement case study

âœ… Problem: Shoppers often hesitate to buy clothes online because they cannot see how they would look on them.
âœ… Solution: Our segmentation + inpainting pipeline allows users to swap clothing items on a model or their own photo.

âœ… How It Works:
- Use SAM/ClipSeg to segment clothing areas.
- Use inpainting (Stable Diffusion) to replace the item with a different outfit.
- The result: A realistic try-on without the need for physical fitting rooms.



ðŸ’¡ Example Use Case:

- A user uploads a photo, selects a t-shirt style, and our model replaces their existing outfit with a new one.
- Fashion brands can visualize different styles on the same model without multiple photoshoots.
